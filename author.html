				Hi everyone! My name is Dave and I live in Kansas-Сity, state Kansas.
				</p>

				<p>
				I have my own small business. As a true American, I offer you true American things: Barbeque and Motorcycles. I have already been already a couple of years in this business and you will not be indiffernet to the quality of my work.
				</p>

				<p>
				I started having a small garage on the outskits of the city and I did everything by myself. Barbeque and Workshop were placed together in a small garage. But nevertheless my visitors were satisfied with my work and returned with new offers. Now I have a small workshop and a Barbeque restaurant. As a tradition they are placed near each other, but hopefully it’s two different bulidings.

				We are honest and ready to all your reviews because we want us to make our work as better as possible.</p>
